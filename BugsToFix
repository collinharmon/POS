In Employee Screen: If user without man privilege presses the cancel button it grants him access to manager screen.
This will allow him to perform all manager functions.

In Manager Screen

Add Employee:
If all fields are empty and user hits submit the JFrame (EmployeeInfo.java) closes with no error message.
No submission in database occurs.
If hourly wage is above a certain value no insertion into the database occurs and there isn't an error message.
Password entry doesn't verify if the input is an integer (since users can only enter passwords with dialpad (0-9)).

Add Item:
No helpful error messages for empty/incorrect inputs for quantity and release dates.
Allows duplicate entries (i.e. if a game already exists you can add the game again creating a separate entry
into the database. (Not sure if this would be considered an error. An argument could be made for duplicate entries).

Remove Item:
"Invalid input: Item ID must be a 5 digit number" --> 8 digit.
Correct sku but incorrect Item Name claims the removal was successful but fails.

Edit Price:
If correct SKU but the new price isn't an integer the error messsage states ID (SKU) must be 8 digits.
No error message for super large prices. No modification to the database occurs and nothing happens.

Inventory Levels:
Search function doesn't work (but is this for a future feature to be added?)

Void Transaction:
If order ID exists but EID is incorrect it says "No such order exists" change to "No such order/eid pair exists"
